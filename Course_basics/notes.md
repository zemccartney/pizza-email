# 1st Section — HTML Email Basics

- Email is a seriously limited environment! lots of variation between email providers

- Step 1 in process — what's the email for?
  - 2 overarching categories
    - One-to-many: allow flourish in design
      - SUBGOALS:
        - Read Me (newsletters)
        - Buy Me (ecommerce emails / ads)
        - Join Me (invitations: require info hierarchy; provide detail and cta)
    - Transactional: should be concise, to the point
      - eminently practical
      - light on detail
      - but also comprehensive
      - MAKE IT PRINTABLE IS USED FOR RECORD KEEPING (e.g. invoices)


- Pizzaman email: One-to-many, Read Me
  - dependent on good writing (WHAT IS GOOD? short, simple, chunked)
  - effective use of typography


- Design principles
  - Images
    - don't rely to get message across because some email clients disable images by default
    or for first time senders; user can disable as well
    - use absolute paths to images hosted on your server....
      - ***TODO**** WHY???
  - Typography; options are limited
  - Call to action
    - descriptive
    - emphasized, prioritized
    - give users a reason to take the action
    - plain language, declarative; don't be pushy! shit's not as urgent to readers
    as it is to you; respect that to your audience, you are one of many, a transactor;
    so just be efficient, plain, direct, simple, twist of personality
  - Keep width at 600px
    - b/c most email clients have narrow viewports
